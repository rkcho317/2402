/*The plan is save the input as a string, 
pass it to isDigit as a string, 
make sure all elements are numbers with one “.”. 
If that’s true, return a 1 (true). 
Then call is float and look for that one “.”, 
which is silly because it seems we can do that in isDigit(). 
If it returns a 1, we turn that string into a float in the .asm file*/
